# Changes from upstream

Enigmatic Legacy is owned by Aizistral (Aizistral Studios). This file lists every way
this port differs from the upstream mod, as the Enigmatic Legacy License requires.

Upstream base: https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/Enigmatic-Legacy, branch `1.20.X`,
commit `a0294f1` (mod version 2.30.1, Forge 1.20.1).

## All versions

- (none yet; no upstream code has been ported)

## Per version

Sections are added here as each Minecraft version / loader is ported.

### 1.20.1 Fabric (`1.20.1/`, in progress)

- Build: Forge Gradle replaced with Fabric Loom (Mojang mappings + Parchment).
  Upstream's `EL_logo.png` is used as the mod icon.
- New files (not in upstream): `com.aizistral.enigmaticlegacy.fabric.EnigmaticLegacyFabric`
  and `EnigmaticLegacyFabricClient` (Fabric entry points), `fabric.mod.json`.
- Dependencies: Curios -> Trinkets; playtime capability -> Cardinal Components API;
  Patchouli kept (Fabric build).
- Mod version: `2.30.1+fabric.N`, where N counts port releases.
- Build only: Trinkets is pulled from the Modrinth maven (the TerraformersMC maven jar of
  3.7.2 crashes Mojang-mapped dev runs). No effect on the released mod.
